# Arduino Smart weather Station
 The smart Arduino powered weather station with temperature sensors

- You need a webserver/web-service with PHP to use and configure the logging and temperature vs- time graphs.

## Components and Hardware needed:
- Microprocessor: Arduino Uno (I use the Ardunio Pro mini with an USB-to-serial).
- Temperature sensors: 2x 10k Ohm Thermistors.
- Voltage-divider resistors for temperature sensors: 2x 10k Ohm Resistors.
- Humidity sensor: DHT1.

## Output / Display:
1) 1x DVD-segment Display with 7-digit 7-segment 
2) 1x 4-digit 7-segment display.
3) 1x-∞ 1602 / 2004 LCD with I²C (More LCD need to be added by code)

The PCB can be ordered online or DIY-etched.
